###Core Formulas

Most of the calculations shown in stats are derived from these formulas and utilize the chain rule &amp; inclusion-exclusion principles of probability.

####Factorial

For a given `number`, multiply it by `number - 1` until `number` equals `0` and return the final product.

<pre><code>function factorial(number) {
  if (number === 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  else if (number < 0) {
    return false;
  }
  return (number * factorial(number-1));
}</code></pre>

####Combination

Given `n` possible cards, calculate all possible combinations using `r` number of them.

<pre><code>function C(n, r) {
  return factorial(n)/(factorial(r) * factorial(n-r));
}</code></pre>

####Hypergeometric Distribution

Given a deck of `N` cards, where there are `k` cards we want, calculate the chance of drawing `x` number of `k` cards, given that we draw `n` cards with no replacement.

<pre><code>// N = cards in deck
// k = number of successful cards
// n = draws
// x = number of successes in draw
function hypergeometric(N, k, n, x) {
  var kCx = factorial(k) / (factorial(k-x) * factorial(x));
  var NkCnx = factorial(N-k) / (factorial((N-k) - (n-x)) * factorial(n-x));
  var NCn = factorial(N) / (factorial(N-n) * factorial(n));

  var p = kCx * NkCnx / NCn;
  return p;
}</code></pre>

####Drop Chance Per Turn

Drop chance calculates the chance of *not* having a successful draw, given a sequence of of draw/replace operations and then uses the inclusion-exclusion principle to return the chance of drawing successfully at any point in the sequence.

<pre><code>// Drop returns the chance of getting a COUNT of cards by a number of TURNS
function drop(count, turns) {
  var chance = [];
  var deck = 39;
  // chance of not getting it on draw
  chance.push(hypergeometric(deck, count, 5, 0));
  deck -= 5;
  // according to the devs, mulligan doesn't let you re-draw your mulligan
  // chance of not getting it on first mulligan draw
  deck--;
  chance.push((deck - count)/deck);
  // second mulligan draw
  deck--;
  chance.push((deck - count)/deck);
  // but you do replace those 2 afterward
  deck += 2;
  // replace on opener
  deck++;
  chance.push((deck - count)/deck);
  deck--;


  // but wait, there's more!
  for (var i = 1; i <= turns - 1; i++) {
    // Keep drawing, friend
    deck--;
    chance.push((deck - count)/deck);
    // And remember, you have a replace every turn
    deck++;
    chance.push((deck - count)/deck);
    deck--;
  }

  chance = chance.reduce(function(a, b) {
    return a * b;
  })

  return 1 - chance;
}</code></pre>

### Calculations

#### Turn 1 2-Drop Chance

Determine the number of 2-drop units in a deck, where any 'Unit' card with a mana cost from 0-2 is considered a 2-drop unit. The count of 2-drop units is the number of successes (`k` in the hypergeometric distribution). Use it to calculate `drop()`.

<pre><code>drop(2DropCount, 1)</code></pre>

#### 2-Drop Count Distribution

- Does not take into account opening replace

Using `hypergeometric()`, calculate the chance of drawing exactly `x` successes, where `x` ranges from `0` to `5`. Because the mulligan doesn't let you draw a card you already drew, we can sum up the entire sequence as 'draw 7 without replace'.

<pre><code>hypergeometric(39, 2DropCount, 7, 0)
hypergeometric(39, 2DropCount, 7, 1)
hypergeometric(39, 2DropCount, 7, 2)
hypergeometric(39, 2DropCount, 7, 3)
hypergeometric(39, 2DropCount, 6, 4) // You have 4, so only mulligan 1
hypergeometric(39, 2DropCount, 5, 5) // No mulligan available</code></pre>

#### Starting Draw Distribution

Calculate the chance of drawing a card on turn 1 by using `drop(copyCount, 1)`, where the copy count of a card is `k`, the number of successes.

<pre><code>drop(1, 1)
drop(2, 1)
drop(3, 1)</code></pre>

#### Turn 1 Hand Chance

- Does not take into account opening replace
- Calculates the chance of drawing *exactly* those cards (ie. drawing 1x is a success, drawing 2x of the card is not)
- Does not properly calculate a turn 1 where you draw 4-5 cards you want and can't mulligan 2

For each card wanted, use the chain rule to calculate the number of successful combinations `C(totalNumberOfCopies, copiesWanted)` that contain the wanted cards. Divide that by `C(39, 7)`, which represents all possible hands, to determine the chance of drawing the wanted hand on turn 1.

<pre><code>var chance = 1;

for (var card in wanted) {
  chance = chance * C(cardCopy.count, wantedCard.count);
}
// and then any cards for the rest of the hand
chance = chance * C(39 - hand, 7 - hand);

// there are a total of 39C7 hands
return chance/C(39,7);
</code></pre>

####Card Draw Distribution

Use `drop()` to calculate the chance of drawing the card during a `turn` where the copy count of the card is `k`.

<pre><code>drop(1, turn)
drop(2, turn)
drop(3, turn)</code></pre>

####Win Condition Draw Distribution

Given a starting hand, calculate the chance of drawing a card by a certain turn. This assumes that you've already gone through your mulligan and opening replace and that the only source of new cards is through your turn's draw/replace.

After your opening turn, given a `count` number of copies of the desired card left in the deck, where `deckCount = 39 - 5 (opening hand) - turn (draw)`, calculate the chance of drawing the card.

<pre><code>var chance = 1;

// attempt to replace
deckCount++;
chance = chance * ((deckCount - count)/deckCount);
deckCount--;

// attempt to draw
chance = chance * ((deckCount - count)/deckCount);
deckCount--;
chance = 1 - chance;</code></pre>
